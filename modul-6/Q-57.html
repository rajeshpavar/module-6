// 3 How to Use JavaScript Events

// You can use JavaScript events by adding event listeners to elements. An event listener is a function that waits for a specific event to happen and then runs code when it does.

       // example
       let button = document.getElementById("btn");


button.addEventListener("click", function() {
    alert("Button is clicked!");
});
